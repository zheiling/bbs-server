# Bulletin Board System (Server Side)
This is my sandbox project. I made it test and develop my programming skills. Maybe one day it become a mature and production-ready project.

## Setup
1. Create necessary file structure by running `$ ./setup.sh`.
It will create all necessary file structure in order to run the program correctly and will create a test user `user` with password `1234` with all privileges. **Delete this user before running into production!** It will also create a test file inside the `wdir/storage/` directory.

2. Build the binary running `$ make` or `$ make server`
3. Run it by `$ make run`
